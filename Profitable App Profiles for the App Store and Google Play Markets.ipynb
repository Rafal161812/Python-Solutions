    "### Profitable Apps And The Drivers For Growing Our User Base\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is aimed at delivering an analysis of the key performance indicators for the apps sold via [Apple](https://www.apple.com/uk/ios/app-store/) and [Google](https://play.google.com/store?hl=en) store. Having an understanding of the main drivers of our user base in correlation with apps profitablity in each online store should give us a valuable insight to help with all future development work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our company builds apps that are free to download and install, and our main source of revenue consists of in-app ads.This means our revenue for any given app is mostly influenced by the number of users who use our app — the more users that see and engage with the ads, the better. Our goal for this project is to analyze data to help our developers understand what type of apps are likely to attract more users.\n",

    "For each genre in the Apple's data set we have made two calculations. First one, to get the average number of ratings per app in each genre, and second one, to get the median value of all ratings in each genre. The reason why we decided to see median values is because we know that averages are sensitive to outliers. There could be an app or two in each genre with high (or low) number of ratings that would affect the value of the average and leading us to drawing incorrect conclusion.\n",
    "Based on the output above we can make the following conclusions:\n",
    "* Genres with the highest average number of ratings per app are Social Networking (71546), Reference (74942) and Navigation (86090). The average for Navigation genre is based on only 6 apps, therefore one could assume that it does contain one or two apps with a very high number of ratings. Volume of 6 is a very low number when it comes to sample data therefore, we should omit this genre altogether in drawing further conclusions. Social Networking Genre contains 106 apps and the average number of ratings is high however the median is low for that number of apps in the sample data which suggest that while there will be some successful apps in that genre, many others are not doing that well. Reference genre contains only 18 apps and the average is high, median value is also pretty high when compared to others therefore this genre should be on our list for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Genres that should be worth of our attention are Productivity and Shopping. The average number of ratings for both genres is not the highest, however when those are referenced with the corresponding median values, we can conclude that those genres are very popular and could present good opportunities for future work. As an example, not surprisingly the Games genre contains the largest number of apps (1874) and the average number of ratings per each app comes out at 22789. However, the median value for Games is only 901, which means that half of all Games (937 apps) attracted insignificant attention from potential customers. Saturation of the games market is huge, and it will be much harder for any developer to release the game that will stand out from the others. On the other side, **Shopping** genre contains 84 apps with the average of ratings at 26920, slightly higher than the Games genre's average. However, the median value for Shopping is a whopping 5936 which means that chances of releasing a successful app in that genre are much higher. With traditional brick and mortar stores being replaced by online shops, it is no wonder that apps in such genre gain on popularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Genres we would probably want to avoid are the Weather, Book and News. While Book and Weather have high values of the average ratings per app, all three returned extremely low median values. That means that those groups contain at least 1 outlier, a very successful app with large number of ratings whereas majority of the apps in those genres proved to be undesirable.\n",

Instead of exact number of downloads, each app has been marked with an open-ended grouping which could make our comparision even harder (for example: 10,000+, 50,000+ etc.). However, we can simplfy our approach to this by using the bottom value of each range for each app. This will require converting values representing each range into numbers which can be achieved only after removal of other non-numeric characters (commas and plus signs).\n"

    "In this project, we went through a complete data science workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "* We started by clarifying the goal of our project.\n",
    "* We collected relevant data.\n",
    "* We cleaned the data to prepare it for analysis.\n",
    "* We analyzed the cleaned data.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the above led us to a conslusion that the development of apps in the **shopping** genre may yield a very successful product. Apps in the shopping genre performed very well in both online stores, with the average number of downloads per app scoring higher when compared to other genres and also very strong median values, which have been maintained after removal of the highest scoring apps in the genre.  \n",
    "Not only this, it has been a long term trend for the online sales market growing in a very rapid pace which is expected to continue in the current world we live in, dominated by ever changing technology and a trend of moving out from shopping in the brick and mortar stores."
