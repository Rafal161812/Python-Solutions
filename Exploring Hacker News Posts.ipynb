    "\n",
    "\n",
    "[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) is a project that came ouf of the startup incubator called [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/), where user-submitted stories are voted and commented upon. Hacker News website attracts large volumes of visitors from the technology and startup circles which explain popularity of that portal.\n",
    "  \n",
    "We're specifically interested in posts whose titles begin with either Ask HN or Show HN. **Ask HN** posts are aimed at asking the Hacker News community a specific question. **Show HN** posts are aimed at showing the Hacker News community a project, product, or just generally something interesting\n",
    "\n",
    "Objective of this project is to explore the Hacker News dataset and to answer the following questions:\n",
    "* Which of the two types of posts receive more comments on average\n",
    "* Analyze the distribution of posts over certain times and determine the most popular times\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set contains the following column headers:\n",
    "* **id:**  The unique identifier from Hacker News for the post\n",
    "* **title:** The title of the post\n",
    "* **url:** The URL that the posts links to, if it the post has a URL\n",
    "* **num_points:** The number of points the post acquired, calculated as the total number of upvotes minus the total number of downvotes\n",
    "* **author:** The username of the person who submitted the post\n",
    "* **created_at:** The date and time at which the post was submitted\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to seperate the headers from the rest of the data for future work on this dataset.\n",
